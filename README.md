# HDA TDS Group 4
## About this project üìΩÔ∏è

This project is prepared for the Translational Data Science module as part of MSc Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning. Group 4 has been tasked to utilise UK Biobank (UKB) and implement one of the most cutting-edge techniques Mendelian Randomisation (MR) in epidemiology to assess the causal relationship between Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), its subtypes Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Colon Cancer. 

We adopted the Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as instrumental variables to infer the causal relationship between IBD (and UC and CD respectively) and Colon Cancer.

We used the European cohort of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) to select the IBD-associated SNPs and to generate the weights of those SNPS, the causal inference between IBD and colon cancer was performed in the UKB cohort. We used the UKB genotype data, cancer diagnosis, lifestyle factors, medication, dietary habits, biomarkers. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) was linked to the UKB data by the unique eid identifier of participants, from which we used the non-cancer disease outcomes.

In addition to the observational analysis and the main MR analysis, we have studied potential confounding variables using LASSO, sPLS and Random Forest models, used the selected/important covariates to attenuate the observational associations between IBD and colon cancer. We have queried the selected SNPS and checked for potential confounders using PhenoScanner, performed logistic regressions between the individual IBD-associated SNPs and colon cancer, followed by a set of sensitivity analyses (WM, IVW and MR-Egger etc) to assess the assumptions of the MR analysis.

### Installation üñ±Ô∏è

Clone the repo.

   git clone https://github.com/xinzhao13/TDS_Group4.git
   cd TDS_Group4
   ```

### Preparation and running the pipeline üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èÔ∏è

1. Install R libraries listed above üëÜ in your Conda R on the HPC. 
    * It is recommended to submit the bash scripts to the HPC, and not to overload RStudio Server. 
    * To navigate to Conda R, run the following code:
   ```sh
   module load anaconda3/personal
   R
   ``` 
2. Create "data" folder under the directory.
3. Locate the UKB and HES data and save in the data folder.
4. Download the summarised data from IBD Genetics Consortium from [here](https://www.ibdgenetics.org/downloads.html) and save in the data folder.
5. Change the path defined in all bash files from `path=/rds/general/project/hda_students_data/live/Group4/General/full_scripts` to your project directory.
6. Run the pipeline in the following order to reproduce the project.
    ```sh
    qsub Job_Submission_DataCreation.sh
    qsub Job_Submission_Visualisation1.sh
    qsub Job_Submission_Visualisation2.sh
    qsub Job_Submission_SensitivityAnalysis1.sh
    qsub Job_Submission_SensitivityAnalysis2.sh
    qsub Job_Submission_SensitivityAnalysis3.sh
    ````
