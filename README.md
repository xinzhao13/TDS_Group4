# HDA TDS Group 4
## About this project 📽️

This project is prepared for the Translational Data Science module as part of MSc Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning. Group 4 has been tasked to utilise UK Biobank and implement one of the most cutting-edge techniques Mendelian Randomisation in Computational Epidemiology to assess the causal relationship between Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), its subtypes Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Colon Cancer.
